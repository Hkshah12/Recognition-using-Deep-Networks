# Recognition-using-Deep-Networks
In this project, I build, train, and analyze a deep neural network for MNIST digit recognition using PyTorch, with extensions to transfer learning on Greek letters and network optimization experiments. I cover tasks from constructing the model to evaluating its performance on new and custom inputs.
